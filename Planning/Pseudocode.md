New page code:
Get new file and call it page 2
Has to be .html
Use A tag (link)

Beggining of draft code:

Player 1 variable
Player 2 variable
(FOR HIGH SCORE TABLE)

Need 3 pages 
(INSTRUCTIONS, HOME PAGE AND GAME PAGE(MOST IMPORTANT)) 

Will need a 15x15 chart
(Randomly generate colors)
Probably generate numbers 1-4 each with their own color

1=Blue
2=Purple
3=Green
4=Yellow

Will need 2D arrays for table rows
[[1,2,3,4][2,4,1,2]]

Let player1_score = 0
Let player2_score = 0

function score(){

}

function generaterandom(){


}

function colorchart(){


}
needs to check of the blocks beside it are the right color and if that block is touching one that is the right color aswell

Only keep the border around each square for noe to see but when it is filled with color delete.
